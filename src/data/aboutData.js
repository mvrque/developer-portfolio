    description2: "I am working in a manufacturing industry producing high quality e-bikes. Working in a sustainable factory with a wide range of different tools and technologies. Having intense workflows and collaboration with other team members has secured satisfaction in our customers. It is good to know that one bike makes a huge impact towards our climate! Using different technologies sparked an interest in building my own software to make the world a better place! I took it upon myself to learn Javascript - from design to testing and documentation. While producing quality bikes i am also leaning into my engineering skillset to work with different clients and to freelance. I am ready to join a product team to build software that people love!",
