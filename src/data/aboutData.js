    description2: "I started software engineering in 2022 January at 100Devs. I specialize in full-stack web development. I really enjoy creating new cool projects and solving the problems that are occurring while building programs. Before that i have been working as a bike mechanic. Working with bikes is kinda the same as bulding an application, fixing one thing can lead you to another problem, but eventually the bike rides smoothly.",
